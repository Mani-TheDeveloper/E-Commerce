My E-Commerce Website:

Introduction:

Hi! This is my E-Commerce Website project, where I had to build a simple online shopping site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s not a real shopping website, but it fetches fake product data from an API and lets you add/remove items from the cart and see the total cost with discounts and fees.

Features:

Here are some cool things you can do on my website:

See a list of products with images, prices, and ratings.
Add items to your cart with just one click.
View your cart at any time to see what you’ve added.
Remove items from your cart if you change your mind.
See a detailed breakdown of the price, including discounts and fees.

How to Run the Project:
You can run this project on your own computer by following these steps:

Download the project: You can either download the ZIP file or clone the project from my GitHub repository.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-project.git

Open the website: After downloading, open the index.html file in your browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Play around: Browse the products, add them to the cart, and see how the price changes when you add or remove items.

Or Else:
Use my GitHub repository Link : https://mani-thedeveloper.github.io/E-Commerce/

Challenges I Faced:
Since I’m a beginner, I had a bit of a learning curve with JavaScript, especially with:

Fetching data from the API.
Making sure the cart updates properly.
Calculating the total price with extra charges like shipping.
But I learned a lot from this project, and I’m really proud of how it turned out and  Get the Confidence!! 

Improvements I Could Make:
If I had more time, I would:

Add more detailed product descriptions.
Include quantity selection for each product.
Make it look nicer on mobile devices (I tried, but it can always be better!).

How I Built This
I built this website using:

HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the page and making it look nice.
JavaScript: To add functionality like fetching product data, adding items to the cart, and calculating the total price.

Thank You for Checking Out My Project!
This was a great learning experience for me, and I hope you enjoy checking it out as much as I enjoyed making it!
